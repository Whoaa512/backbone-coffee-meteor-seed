Meteor Template
===============

Structure
---------

Comes with a /client, /server, /lib and /public folder.

Use the /client and /server folders to serve files only to the client or server.

Use the /lib folder for all files that need to be loaded before anything else (e.g. Underscore.js)

Use the /public folder to serve files that will be directly accessible (e.g. images, zip files, etc)
